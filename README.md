<h2> Inspiration ðŸ”¥</h2>
<p>

This project is inspired by the original [celo composer](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer) . I started this fork as an improvment to the original project because I find response to PR and Issue a bit slow than I expected, and which I figured its likely due to the busy schedule of the team at the moment and that is where you and I as a community memeber comes to help ðŸ˜Ž.
</p>

<p>
Contributuing to the original branch makes more sense but with the response friction, I would rather work on this branch with help from the community while keeping in touch with the Celo Devrel team to make sure this projects aligns with the original projects mission which is to anyone quickly build, deploy, and iterate on decentralized applications using Celo.
